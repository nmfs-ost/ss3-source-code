## How to submit a pull request to Stock Synthesis

All code contributions should be submitted as pull requests to be reviewed by an SS3 team member.

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the stock synthesis repository (or, if you are a member of the nmfs-stock-synthesis organization, clone the repository).
2. Create a new branch, make the changes, and test out by [building stock synthesis](#how-to-build-stock-synthesis-from-source) locally.
3. Commit the changes and push up to the github fork.
4. [Submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to the main branch of Stock Synthesis Repository.
5. An SS3 team member will work with you to accept or make corrections to the pull request.

## How to build Stock Synthesis from source

1. Have a local version of the stock synthesis repository (though forking or cloning).
2. Download [ADMB](http://www.admb-project.org/). The current version of ADMB used to compile Stock Synthesis is listed in [SS_versioninfo_330safe.tpl](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis/blob/main/SS_versioninfo_330safe.tpl).
3. Add ADMB to the PATH or use the ADMB command window for the following commands.
4. On Linux or Mac:
- Change directory to the cloned Stock Synthesis repository and use the script [Make_SS_330_new.sh](https://github.com/nmfs-stock- synthesis/stock-synthesis/blob/main/Make_SS_330_new.sh) by calling `./Make_SS_330_new.sh`. To see all options for the function, use `./Make_SS_330_new.sh --help`.
- Follow the instructions found in the [GNUmakefile](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis/blob/main/GNUmakefile) which will allow you to compile Stock Synthesis using the command `~/stock-synthesis$ make` within a command line opened in the cloned Stock Synthesis repository folder.
6. On Windows: Change directory to the cloned Stock Synthesis repository's [Compile](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis/tree/main/Compile) subfolder and call the [Make_SS_safe batch script](https://github.com/nmfs-stock-synthesis/stock-synthesis/blob/main/Compile/Make_SS_safe.bat) to build the "safe" version of Stock Synthesis. (to build the fast (aka optimized) version of Stock Synthesis, call the Make_SS_fast.bat batch scripts instead). Upon calling the batch script, SS3 will be built in the Compile subfolder.
