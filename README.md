Stock Synthesis (SS3) is a generalized age-structured population dynamics model implemented in [ADMB](http://www.admb-project.org/). It is used to assess the effect of fisheries on fish and shellfish stocks while taking into account the influence of environmental factors.

## Tools for working with Stock Synthesis

As Stock Synthesis usage has grown, so has the number of tools to work with it. These include [repositories on github with the stock-synthesis topic](https://github.com/topics/stock-synthesis) as well as:

- [r4ss](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss): Create plots of Stock Synthesis output and functions to work with Stock Synthesis in R.
- [ss3diags](https://github.com/PIFSCstockassessments/ss3diags): Run advanced diagnostics for Stock Synthesis models.
- [ss3sim](https://github.com/ss3sim/ss3sim): Conduct simulation studies using Stock Synthesis.
- [SSI](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis/document-library/-/document_library/0LmuycloZeIt/view/5042951): Stock Synthesis Interface, a GUI for developing models and running Stock Synthesis. Links to r4ss.
- [SS3 Shiny helper app](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/ss3-helper/): Visualize common selectivity pattern options available within Stock Synthesis.
- [SSMSE](https://github.com/nmfs-fish-tools/SSMSE): Use Stock Synthesis operating models in Management Strategy Evaluation.
- [sa4ss](https://github.com/nwfsc-assess/sa4ss): Create accessible R markdown stock assessment documents with results from Stock Synthesis models. Note this tool is intended for use by analysts within the Northwest and Southwest Fisheries Science Centers currently.
- Data limited tools - Options included Simple Stock Synthesis ([SSS](https://github.com/shcaba/SSS)) and Extended Simple Stock Synthesis ([XSSS](https://github.com/chantelwetzel-noaa/XSSS)), as well as [SS-DL-tool](https://github.com/shcaba/SS-DL-tool), a shiny app that includes XSSS and SSS in its functionality.
